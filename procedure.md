### Pre-Experiment Setup
1. Before starting the experiment, familiarize yourself with:
   - Initial propositions
   - Axioms
   - Inference rules (Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, etc.)
2. Complete the pretest to assess your initial understanding

### Part 1: Demo - Understanding Logical Derivations
1. Navigate to the demo section of the experiment
2. You will be presented with:
   - A list of axioms
   - Available inference rules
   - Sample derivations
3. Each derivation shows:
   - The premises (given statements)
   - The steps of reasoning
   - The conclusion

### Part 2: Interactive Learning
1. Hover over any step in the derivation process
2. Observe in the Explanations section:
   - The specific formulae used
   - Which inference rule was applied
   - How the conclusion was reached
3. Practice with different steps to understand various inference patterns
4. Make sure you understand how each step follows from the previous ones

### Part 3: Truth Table Exercise
1. You will be presented with pairs of logical sentences
2. Your task is to verify or disprove their logical equivalence
3. Steps to complete the exercise:
   - Study the given sentences carefully
   - Fill in the truth table with appropriate values (0s and 1s)
   - Enter values only from the set {0, 1}
   - Double-check your work
   - Click "Verify" to check your answers
4. The system will evaluate your answers and provide feedback in the Observations section
5. If all answers are correct, click "Next" to proceed to a different question

### Part 4: Assessment
1. Complete the posttest to evaluate your understanding
2. Review any concepts that were challenging
3. Refer to the theory section if needed

### Tips for Success
- Take time to understand each inference rule before proceeding
- Pay attention to the logical symbols and their meanings
- When filling truth tables, work systematically from left to right
- Make sure to fill in all required values before verification
- If you make a mistake, review the logical rules and try again
- Use the References section for additional learning resources
