The main purpose of this experiment is to formally introduce the student to compound propositions obtained from atomic propositions using logical connectives, and study the inferences obtained from them. In particular, this experiment is proposed to familiarize student with the formal notions of axioms and derivations. We shall also intend to introduce derived connectives and inference rules such as <i>Modus Ponens</i>. We hope to also introduce the notion of logical equivalence through this experiment.
