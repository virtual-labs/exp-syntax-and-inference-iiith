1. The demo has some examples of logical derivations. You can view the initial propositions, axioms, and inference rules beforehand. 

2. Click on any step of the derivation to see the formulae and inference rules used for that step in the Explanations section.

3. In the experiment, you will be asked to verify/disprove the logical equivalence of some sentences by using a truth table. You must fill in the correct values and submit.
